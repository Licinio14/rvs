## 🌟 About RVS

RVS is more than just a clothing brand—it's a story of friendship, determination, and creative passion brought to life. Born from the collaborative vision of three software developers turned fashion innovators, RVS represents the perfect fusion of technology and style.

### 💫 Our Story

The name RVS emerges from the founders' surnames (Rio, Vale, Sousa), symbolizing the unique bond that sparked this creative venture. What began as a shared dream during a software development course has evolved into a dynamic fashion brand dedicated to self-expression and individual style.

### 🎯 Our Vision

At RVS, we bring the precision of software development into fashion design:
- Modern and versatile collections
- Sustainable manufacturing processes
